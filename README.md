# gemuruh-jiwa
gemuruh-jiwa means the roar of the soul! 

# Motivation
Write a library/module in Typescript that can be used like - 
- npm install
- use it in both Javascript and Typescript code
- support both CommonJS and ESM syntax
- seamlessly integrates with popular build tools e.g webpack,node, etc

# Why
Coz it's weekend and it's me time :grinning:
